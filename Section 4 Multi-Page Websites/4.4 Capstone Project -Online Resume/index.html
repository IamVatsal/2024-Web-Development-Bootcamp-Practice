        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
          I'm pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering and am a member of
          the Art & Literature Club. I have had a passion for computers since
          childhood and am eager to learn how they work and the fundamental
          principles behind them. Currently, I am studying web development
          alongside my college coursework to achieve financial freedom.
